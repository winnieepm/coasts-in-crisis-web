## Naming Conventions

To ensure the clarity of file organization in the repo, please follow the following rules when naming or renaming files any under root-level directories.

```HTML
yyyy-mm-dd_a few keywords.extension
```
Example:
```HTML
2021-11-12_launch event poster.pdf
```
* Root-level directories do not require date, and should be named with a few keywords. See metadata/ or styling/. Note that 01_documentation and 02_backups were assigned numbers in their name to guarantee that they will remain the first two directories in the repository.

* For subdirectories, follow the same rules but do not add a file extension, as there isn't any. 

* For files with unknown exact date, only enter available information and do not approximate unknown details. 


Directory (folder) with known year but no exact date:

```HTML
2021_launch event documents
```
